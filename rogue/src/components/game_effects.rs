//------------------------------------------------------------------
// Game effects components
//
// These components tag entities as having certain effects when used withing
// various game contexts. Some of these fall into general classes:
//
//   - [...]WhenUsed components indicate effects of an item/spell when selected
//     from the use item menu, i.e., when used as an untargeted effect.
//   - [...]WhenTargeted components inficate effects of an item/spell when used as
//     a targeted effect.
//
//  Note that some entities (for example, potions) have different effects when
//  targeted vs. untargeted.
//
//   - [...]WhenEncroachedUpon indicate effects that an entity has on any other
//     entity occupying the same tile.
